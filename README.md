### Hello world 👋

I'm Etienne , I am 31 yo and I'm French.

👀 I like traveling around the world and gastronomy, Asia which is a fascinating continent, music particularly reggae and hip hop, and team sports 🏀 ⚽️   
And of course coding, but you’ve probably already guessed that?!

👨🏼‍🍳 After 12 years in the restaurant industry, winter in the French Alps and summer on the Atlantic coast, I decided to completely change career. No more plates giving me lines of code! 🧑‍💻

💻 I just finished a 5-month training at the Wild Code School in Bordeaux, I am now looking for a company or freelance projects to continue to have fun and enrich myself in this new world for me

During this formation i learned HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, Figma, PHP, Symfony, Twig, Javascript, MySQL,... I've now started various projects to try and master the secrets of The Force! 🧙‍♂️ 

🚀 I’m looking to collaborate on any project with a joyful fellowship.
